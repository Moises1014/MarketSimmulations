 * I affirm that this program is entirely my own work and none of it is the work
 * of any other person.
 *
 * This class was made to run and do a stock simulator when the user say so, 
 * like for example buy, or sell a stock. The buy method here does the 
 * calculations by adding the stock to queue of blocks. The sell does the 
 * same thing  while also adding to the profits made(since your selling). After
 * the next if's statements will do the calculations the gains from the stock 
 * being sold or bought and show it to the users. IF quit is put by the user 
 * the simulation will end.
